# Witch Text Based Game

> ### By Alexis Tolliver

## Summary of Project

This project is a text-based game I created using Python. The wicked witch broke into your house and will put a spell on your entire family which will make them laugh to death unless you defeat her first. In order to defeat the wicked witch you must collect all 6 items from each room before getting to the witch. Once all 6 items are aquired and you get to the witch you can defeat her, but if you get to the witch before collect all 6 items she wins!
