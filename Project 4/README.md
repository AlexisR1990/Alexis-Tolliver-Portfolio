# Witch Text Based Game

> ### By Alexis Tolliver

## Summary of Project
This project is a text-based game I created using Python. The goal of this game is to collect all 6 items from each room before getting to the witch. Once all 6 items are aquired and you get to the witch you can defeat her, but if you get to the witch before collect all 6 items she wins.
