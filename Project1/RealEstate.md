# Real Estate Housing Analysis
> By Alexis Tolliver

## Summary
Using a real estate company's historical data set I analyzed relationships between the various attributes of a house and the cost of that house using R programming language. The goal is to predict sale prices using these factors to help the real estate company list their client's houses a better prices which could speed up the time it takes for the house to be sold. Below are the different attributes of the house that I using to conduct my analysis.
