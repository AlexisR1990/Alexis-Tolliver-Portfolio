## Summary
This is a personal project of mine where I analyzed an asthma data set of over 2,000 patients, with the intent to view how different health markers, environmental factors, symptoms, and more influence a patient's chance of being diagnosed with asthma. Using Python I preprocessed the data, performed EDA, and created a random forest in order to understand the relationships between the factors more deeply. Once my model was created I obtain various statistics to ensure the model was a good fit for the data and then I pulled a decision tree out for further analysis.


### Variables Used

## Prepare Data Set
First, I had to import all necessary librries and obtain my data set by reading the CSV file and using .head() to view the first 5 rows of my data set.

To view the data types I was working with I used .info() which also allowed me to view all columns and a non-null count.

Just for verification I decided to use .isnull().sum() to check for any missing values in the data set.

Using .describe() was helfpul to understand the data a bit more deeply and have a better idea of possible outliers.

This is where I chose to drop two unnecessary features, PatientID and DoctorInCharge. To ensure the drop worked I used .info().

Next I chose to look at the skewness of each numerical feature. The visualizations below tell me the features ethnicity, smoking, pet allergy, eczema, hayfever, gastroesophageal reflux, and diagnosis are highly skewed.

Now let's take a deeper look into the continuous variables based on the target variable, whether the patient was diagnosed or not.
<img width="1124" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 10 05 07‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1433412-a13a-4253-a45d-7ad063f9369f">
<img width="1134" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 10 06 13‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7cbae62-c758-48ec-8564-4c3de267cce8">


As you can tell from the visuals above the class distribution seems to be unbalanced which is why I chose to visualize the exact class distribution in a bar chart with 0 meaning No Diagnosis and 1 meaning Yes Diagnosis. As you can see there is a lot more No than there is Yes which is a proble when it comes to modeling so now we must balance the classes.
<img width="1129" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 26 16‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed533b2d-0db2-446c-acf1-9d197fde59b8">

Since the class is unbalanced and the majority of the weight is on the No, I chose to use the SMOTE oversampling method. After rebalancing the data I chose to get a recount of the classes in a bar chart, which showed me a perfectly balanced target varible.
<img width="1134" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 28 37‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/377ee439-5596-4515-a499-3054e6c98bd8">

Now that the target variable is balanced we can now split our data into test and train sets.
<img width="1120" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 29 48‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd4cace-784b-48f0-bbfc-481649f0cbe5">

To decide which model to use for this data set I created pipelines for a logistic regression model, decision tree model, and random forest model.
<img width="1124" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 30 29‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e872f5ce-a94f-42ac-ab2d-4f7171aa00fb">

Although the Logistic Regression model has a slightly higher accuracy I decided to start with a random forest model. So next I created the random forest model and fit my data to it which gave me a great accuracy score.
<img width="951" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 34 54‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e6f6c9-3a24-4f89-b16f-3a5077b02af6">


To get a better idea of the model I created a confusion matrix.
<img width="951" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 35 38‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5b226-1e1a-4519-86ac-89b1bc8bdec4">

To get a clearer few I got the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.
<img width="950" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 39 40‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9bdd89-19b7-434e-837a-d8944ee3f0c1">

Getting the classification report of the model was my next step which shows us how the model is doing for each class, which in this case, is great.
<img width="950" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 46 34‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb23a400-1599-476a-861e-d5768a469b5c">

Next I wanted to see the mean absolute error which is 0.04 degrees which is telling us the error of this model is quite small.
<img width="955" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 43 18‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3601428c-8232-4c5f-9619-c9aac2e34e28">

Getting the ROC Curve and the AUC score tells us this model is performing extremely well.
<img width="1126" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 10 49 01‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2adbaa1b-d47d-49e9-8bbd-37261f7ae09c">

So let's get a view into a few of the decison trees created in the random forest model. Below is where I got a quick look into three trees.

Lastly, I use a the for method to visualize a full tree created from the random forest model.
