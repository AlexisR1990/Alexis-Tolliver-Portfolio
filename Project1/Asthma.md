## Summary
This is a personal project of mine where I analyzed an asthma data set of over 2,000 patients, with the intent to view how different health markers, environmental factors, symptoms, and more influence a patient's chance of being diagnosed with asthma. Using Python I preprocessed the data, performed EDA, and created a random forest in order to understand the relationships between the factors more deeply. Once my model was created I obtain various statistics to ensure the model was a good fit for the data and then I pulled a decision tree out for further analysis.


### Variables Used


## Prepare Data Set
First, I had to prepare my data set by reading the CSV file and converting the variables I wanted to work with into factors. To see what I was working with I also got the number of columns and rows.
