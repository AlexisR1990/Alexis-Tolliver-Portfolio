## Summary
During my time at SNHU I was asked to act as a data analyst and use a real estate company's historical data set to analyze relationships between various attributes of a house and its cost. The goal was to predict sale prices based on these attributes to help the real estate company list their client's homes at optimal prices, which could expedite the selling process. Below are the different attributes of the houses that I used in my analysis.

## Prepare Data Set
First, I had to prepare my data set by reading the CSV file and converting the variables I wanted to work with into factors. To see what I was working with I also got the number of columns and rows.
