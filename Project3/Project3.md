## Summary
Acting as a data analyst I was tasked by the university hospital with researching heart disease. Specifically, to analyze the relationships and patterns between a patient's risk for heart disease and various health indicators. Different models were applied to analyze these relationships giving valuable insights that could help others understand factors that could impact their risk of heart disease creating room for possible prevention as well as preparation.
