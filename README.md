# About me

Early in my professional career I worked in childcare until I discovered the Google Data Analytics Certification. This certification marked the beginning of a beautiful journey and ignited my fascination with data. After completing my Google certification, I pursued the Data Analytics Certification through Break Into Data. However, I wanted to delve deeper, so I decided to return to school for a bachelor's degree in Data Analytics with a concentration in Project Management for STEM.

This pivotal moment confirmed that data analytics was my true calling. Since then, I have become fully immersed in the field, gaining proficiency in several tools, including Python, R Programming, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Learning how to clean and preprocess data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and perform various statistical analyses to uncover trends and critical insights. Gaining expertise in creating dashboards and writing reports to communicate my findings effectively to key stakeholders.

As a natural investigator and lifelong learner, I am continually upskilling and expanding my knowledge to stay at the forefront of data analytics, which in additon to my skills and passion would make me a great asset to any organization. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.

# Projects

<br>

> ## R Programming
>> ### [Real Estate Housing Analysis](Project1/RealEstate.md)
>> This project involves using a real estate company's historical data set to analyze various relationships between different attributes of a house and its selling price. For this analysis, I employed a first order regression model incorporating both quantitative and qualitative variables, a complete second order regression model with quantitative variables, and a nested model F-test. These regression models allowed me to predict home sale prices based on different variable factors. The insights gained from this analysis can help the real estate company set more accurate prices for houses, ensuring quicker sales for clients.
>>
>>
>> ### [Credit Risk Analysis](Project2/CreditRisk.md)
>> In this project, I acted as a risk analyst who works for a credit card company. The company tasked me with studying the relationships between customer characteristics and the likelihood of defaulting on their credit using their historical data set. I used R programming to construct a classification decision tree to conduct this risk analysis. Next, I plotted cross-validation errors against cost-complexity, pruned the tree, and plotted the classification decision tree. Then I obtained the confusion matrix to calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall, and made predictions using the classification decision tree. This analysis will enable the company to estimate the risk of customers defaulting based on specific customer characteristics.

> ## Python
>> ### [Witch Text Based Game](Project4/Witch.md)
>> This project is one of the first ones I worked on. It involves creating a text-based game where the player navigates through a house, collecting six inventory items from different rooms before encountering the witch. The objective is to gather all six items and then go to the room with the witch to win the game. If the player encounters the witch before collecting all six items, the witch wins!
