# About me

During my young adulthood, I worked in childcare until I discovered the Google Data Analytics Certification. This certification marked the beginning of a beautiful journey and engnited my facination with data. After completing my Google certficiation, I pursued the Data Analytics Certficiation through Break Into Data. However, I wanted to delve deeper, so I decided to return to school for a bachelor's degree in Data Analtyics with a concentration in Project Management for STEM. 

This pivotal moment confirmed that data analytics was my true calling. Since then, I have become fully emerced in the field, learning how to clean and preprocess data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and perform various statistical analyses to uncover trends and critical insights. Additionally, I have gained expertise in creating dashboards and writing reports to communicate my findings to effectively to key stakeholders.

I have proficiency in several tools, including Python, R Programming, SQL, Excel, and Talbeau. As a natural investigator and lifelong learner, I am continually upsilling and expanding my knowledge to stay at the forefront of data analytics.


# Projects

> ### Project 1: [Real Estate Housing Analysis](Project1/RealEstate.md)
> This project focuses on using a real estate company's historical data set to analyze the various relationships between different attributes of a house and it's selling price. To do this analyss I used a first order regression model with quantitative and qualitative variables, a complete second order regression model with quantitative variables, and a nested model F-test. By creating the various regression models I then was able to predict sale prices of homes based off of the different variable factors. This analysis could then be used to help the real estate company to set better prices for houses which will ensure that the client's listing be sold quicker.

> ### Project 4: [Witch Text Based Game](Project4/Witch.md)
> This project is one of my first projects I worked on. It focuses on how I created a text-based game where you have to go around the house and collect all six inventory items from each room before encountering the witch. If you get all six items then go to the room with the witch in it you win, but if you get to the room with the witch in it before you have all six items, she wins!
